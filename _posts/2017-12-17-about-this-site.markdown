Hello, I'm Erik, and welcome to my blog! I'm a U3 (Senior) at McGill University in Montr&#233;al, Canada, originally from mid-Michigan. I study Russian and Computer Science, alongside a major in Liberal Arts, focusing that within History, Culture, and Society. I've also studied at Harvard University (summer courses), Middlebury College (Russian immersion) at previous points in my life. Presently, I am the President of the [Arts Undergraduate Society](https://ausmcgill.com), representing over 8,000 students at McGill, with my term ending April 30th, 2018. Previously, I have worked as an intern in the Michigan Senate. I speak English, Fran&ccedil;ais, Svenska, and Русский.
